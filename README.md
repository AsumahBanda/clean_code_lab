# 🧼 Clean Code lab

Welcome to the **Clean Code lab** repository!  
This project demonstrates how to write clean, maintainable, and readable code by comparing bad and good examples side-by-side.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Help developers learn clean code principles through practical and visual comparisons using real-world Dart code.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

We use a **folder-based structure** to organize bad and good examples across different categories like functions and classes.


Each file pair inside `/bad` and `/good` folders highlights one clean code scenario.

---

## 📌 Naming Convention

- Each file focuses on a specific concept or anti-pattern.
- File names are consistent across `bad` and `good` folders for easy comparison.
- Use `kebab-case` (e.g., `func-names.dart`) for naming files.

## ✍️ How to Contribute

1. **Clone** this repository.
2. Navigate to the appropriate category (`functions/`, `classes/`, etc.).
3. Create folders `naming/bad/` and `naming/good/` for each concept with corresponding files.
4. Create a minimal, clear example of a bad and improved version.
5. Optionally, include a small comment to explain the concept.
6. Submit a pull request with your changes.

## ✅ Example: `func-names.dart`
